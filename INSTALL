RLGO Installation Instructions
==============================

RLGO uses GNU autotools to configure and build the package.

Prerequisites
=============

RLGO requires the following packages in order to build and run:

a) Boost C++ libraries (version 1.33.1 or higher) must be installed.
b) Fuego 0.4 must be downloaded and built.

RLGO requires the following packages to run experiment scripts:

c) GoGui must be installed.
d) GnuGo must be installed.
e) BayesElo must be installed.
f) GnuPlot must be installed.

However, RLGO can build and run without support for the experiment scripts.

Basic Installation
==================

RLGO needs to know the location of Fuego in order to build. 
For example, if Fuego is installed in the directory fuego-0.4,
and RLGO is installed in the sibling directory rlgo-2.5,
then RLGO would be built as follows:

cd rlgo-2.5
./configure --with-fuego-dir ../fuego-0.4
make

In addition, as when installing Fuego, it is possible to explicitly specify 
the location of the Boost libraries by passing arguments to configure.
Use ./configure --help for more details.

To test some basic functionality of RLGO, build the unit tests:
 
make check

Shared Memory
=============

RLGO can be run in multi-process mode via shared memory. 
However, the system kernel parameter shmmax must be large enough for all weights
(>4Mb for 3x3 local shape features)
